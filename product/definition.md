# Introduction 

The Jukeberry project is intended to generate beautiful geeky mini-jukeboxes, powered Raspberries for everyone to build.

It was originally inspired by other DIY projects using RFID cards to determine what to play next. I imagined endless possibilities for a gadget like this, and so, I'm creating this repo in an attempt of planning, taking notes, writing ideas down, and finally, start building it.

## First EPICs

### Player

* When a user brings an RFID card close to the jukebox, it will start playing the corresponding song right away. [MVP]
* If the user holds the "add to queue" button while passing the RFID card, the song won't play right away but will be added to a queue.
* There will be another button to toggle a random order on and off.
* By default, Jukebox will use its speakers (connected via Bluetooth, plug, hdmi, etc). However, it will be possible to possible to connect compatible devices to Jukeberry where to play music.
  * In case having more than one connected device, a button will let the user choose which one should be reproducing a song.
